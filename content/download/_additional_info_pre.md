There are two architectures available: 64 bit and 32 bit. If you don't know which one you should choose, you can use 64 bit for more modern computers and 32 bit if you computer is an older model. If you don't have enough information about your hardware, choose the 32 bit version, which will run on more hardware.

Both editions have exactly the same features and support and this decision is only important if you need maximum performance.
