Manjaro's repository of free and quality software is filled with programs for each subject. For mathematics, simple to advanced calculations can be done using scientific calculators like [Qalculate!](https://qalculate.github.io/) or [SpeedCrunch](http://www.speedcrunch.org/) that don't copy the experience of most hardware-calculators, but allow free editing of functions and terms.

For more complex mathematics, [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/) and [WxMaxima](http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/) will handle advanced numeric and algebraic tasks. Teachers love [Geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/) to show physics, trigonometry, vector operations and more due to the easy-to-use graphical editing of mathematical relations, plotting of functions and setting constraints.

Physics including molecular dynamics, gravitation and coloumb forces and more can be taught using [Step](https://www.kde.org/applications/education/step/). The earth can be explored with [Marble](https://marble.kde.org/), while the sky and stars can be viewed with [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/).

[Minuet](https://www.kde.org/applications/education/minuet/) brings a software for music education that teaches students ear training, rhythm, harmony and more and provides features for teachers to create own lessons.

Learning is also important for the youngest. [Gcompris](http://gcompris.net/) allows them to play and learn basics of a computer, elementary mathematics, geography, reading and many other things. Included are also games like puzzles, chess, memory and more that will make learning a pleasant and funny experience.

Organizing things is important, too. The Manjaro repository contains software like [Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/) that provides an E-Mail client, a calendar and a news-reader.

To write homework or to create presentations, [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) comes preinstalled.
